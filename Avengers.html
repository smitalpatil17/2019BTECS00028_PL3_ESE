                superhero team of the same name. Produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Studios
                Motion Pictures,[N 1] it is the sixth film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). In the film, Nick
                Fury and the spy agency S.H.I.E.L.D. recruit Tony Stark, Steve Rogers, Bruce Banner, and Thor to
                form a team capable of stopping Thor's brother Loki from subjugating Earth. the film features an
                ensemble cast including Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett
                Johansson, and Jeremy Renner as the Avengers, alongside Tom Hiddleston, Clark Gregg, Cobie Smulders,
                Stellan Skarsg√•rd, and Samuel L. Jackson.</p>
            <p class="card-text">The Asgardian Loki encounters the Other, the leader of an extraterrestrial race
                known as the Chitauri. In exchange for retrieving the Tesseract,[N 2] a powerful energy source of
                unknown potential, the Other promises Loki an army with which he can subjugate Earth. Nick Fury,
                director of the espionage agency S.H.I.E.L.D., arrives at a remote research facility, where
                physicist Dr. Erik Selvig is leading a team experimenting on the Tesseract. The Tesseract suddenly
                activates and opens a wormhole, allowing Loki to reach Earth. Loki steals the Tesseract and uses his
                scepter to enslave Selvig and other agents, including Clint Barton, to aid him.
                In response, Fury reactivates the "Avengers Initiative". Agent Natasha Romanoff heads to Kolkata to
                recruit Dr. Bruce Banner to trace the Tesseract through its gamma radiation emissions. Fury
                approaches Steve Rogers to retrieve the Tesseract, and Agent Phil Coulson visits Tony Stark to have
                him check Selvig's research.
                Loki is in Stuttgart, where Barton steals the iridium needed to stabilize the Tesseract's power,
                leading to a confrontation with Rogers, Stark, and Romanoff that ends with Loki's surrender. While
                Loki gets escorted to S.H.I.E.L.D., his adoptive brother Thor arrives and frees him, hoping to
                convince him to abandon his plan and return to Asgard. Stark and Rogers intervene and Loki is taken
                to S.H.I.E.L.D.'s flying aircraft carrier, the Helicarrier, where he is imprisoned.
                The Avengers become divided over how to approach Loki and the revelation that S.H.I.E.L.D. plans to
                harness the Tesseract to develop powerful weapons as a deterrent against hostile extraterrestrials.
                As they argue, Loki's other possessed agents attack the Helicarrier, and the stress causes Banner to
                transform into the Hulk. Stark and Rogers work to restart the damaged engine, and Thor attempts to
                stop the Hulk's rampage. Romanoff knocks Barton unconscious, breaking Loki's mind control. Loki
                escapes after killing Coulson and Fury uses Coulson's death to motivate the Avengers into working as
                a team. Loki uses the Tesseract and a wormhole generator Selvig built to open a wormhole above Stark
                Tower to the Chitauri fleet in space, launching his invasion.
                Rogers, Stark, Romanoff, Barton, Thor, and the Hulk rally in defense of New York City, and together
                the Avengers battle the Chitauri. The Hulk beats Loki into submission. Romanoff makes her way to the
                generator, where Selvig, freed from Loki's mind control, reveals that Loki's scepter can shut down
                the generator. Fury's superiors from the World Security Council attempt to end the invasion by
                launching a nuclear missile at Midtown Manhattan. Stark intercepts the missile and takes it through
                the wormhole toward the Chitauri fleet. The missile detonates, destroying the Chitauri mothership
                and disabling their forces on Earth. Stark's suit loses power, and he goes into freefall, but the
                Hulk saves him. In the aftermath, Thor returns with Loki and the Tesseract to Asgard, where Loki
                will face their justice.
                In a mid-credits scene, the Other confers with his master[N 3] about the failed attack on Earth.</p>
