                <p class="card-text">Avengers: Endgame is a 2019 American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics
                    superhero team the Avengers. Produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Studios
                    Motion Pictures, it is the direct sequel to Avengers: Infinity War (2018) and the 22nd film in the
                    Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). In the film, the surviving members of the Avengers and their allies
                    attempt to reverse the destruction caused by Thanos in Infinity War.</p>
                <p class="card-text">In 2018, twenty-three days after Thanos killed half of all life in the universe,[N
                    1] Carol Danvers rescues Tony Stark and Nebula from deep space and they reunite with the remaining
                    Avengers—Bruce Banner, Steve Rogers, Thor, Natasha Romanoff, and James Rhodes—and Rocket on Earth.
                    Locating Thanos on an uninhabited planet, they plan to use the Infinity Stones to reverse his
                    actions, but discover Thanos has already destroyed them to prevent further use. Enraged, Thor
                    decapitates Thanos.
                    Five years later, in 2023, Scott Lang escapes from the Quantum Realm.[N 2] Reaching the Avengers
                    Compound, he explains that he experienced only five hours while trapped. Theorizing the Quantum
                    Realm allows time travel, they ask Stark to help them retrieve the Stones from the past to reverse
                    the actions of Thanos in the present. Stark, Rocket, and Banner, who has since merged his
                    intelligence with the Hulk's strength, build a time machine. Banner notes that altering the past
                    does not affect their present; any changes create alternate realities. Visiting the Asgardian
                    refugees' settlement New Asgard, in Norway, Banner and Rocket recruit an overweight and despondent
                    Thor. In Tokyo, Romanoff recruits Clint Barton, who has become a vigilante after the death of his
                    family.
                    Banner, Lang, Rogers, and Stark travel to New York City during Loki's attack in 2012.[N 3] At the
                    Sanctum Sanctorum, Banner convinces the Ancient One to give him the Time Stone after promising to
                    return the various Stones to their proper points in time. At Stark Tower, Rogers retrieves the Mind
                    Stone from Hydra sleeper agents, but Stark and Lang's attempt to steal the Space Stone fails,
                    allowing 2012-Loki to escape with it. Rogers and Stark travel to Camp Lehigh in 1970, where Stark
                    obtains an earlier version of the Space Stone and encounters his father, Howard. Rogers steals Pym
                    Particles from Hank Pym to return to the present and spies his lost love, Peggy Carter.
                    Meanwhile, Rocket and Thor travel to Asgard in 2013;[N 4] Rocket extracts the Reality Stone from
                    Jane Foster, while Thor gets encouragement from his mother, Frigga, and retrieves his old hammer,
                    Mjolnir. Barton, Romanoff, Nebula, and Rhodes travel to 2014; Nebula and Rhodes go to Morag and
                    steal the Power Stone before Peter Quill can,[N 5] while Barton and Romanoff travel to Vormir. The
                    Soul Stone's keeper, Red Skull, reveals it can only be acquired by sacrificing a loved one. Romanoff
                    sacrifices herself, allowing Barton to get the Stone. Rhodes and Nebula attempt to return to their
                    own time, but Nebula is incapacitated when her cybernetic implants link with her past self, allowing
                    2014-Thanos to learn of his future self's success and the Avengers' attempt to undo it. 2014-Thanos
                    sends 2014-Nebula forward in time to prepare for his arrival.
                    Reuniting in the present, the Avengers place the Stones into a gauntlet that Stark, Banner, and
                    Rocket had built. Banner, having the most resistance to their radiation, wields the gauntlet and
                    reverses Thanos's disintegrations. Meanwhile, 2014-Nebula, impersonating her future self, uses the
                    time machine to transport 2014-Thanos and his warship to the present, which he then uses to destroy
                    the Avengers Compound. Present-day Nebula convinces 2014-Gamora to betray Thanos, but is unable to
                    convince 2014-Nebula and kills her. Thanos overpowers Stark, Thor, and a Mjolnir-wielding Rogers and
                    summons his army to retrieve the Stones, intent on using them to destroy the universe and create a
                    new one. A restored Stephen Strange arrives with other sorcerers, the restored Avengers and
                    Guardians of the Galaxy, the Ravagers, and the armies of Wakanda and Asgard to fight Thanos's army.
                    Danvers also arrives and destroys Thanos's warship, but Thanos overpowers her and seizes the
                    gauntlet. Stark obtains the Stones and uses them to disintegrate Thanos and his army, but the strain
                    of using them kills him.
                    Following Stark's funeral, Thor appoints Valkyrie as the new ruler of New Asgard and joins the
                    Guardians. Rogers returns the Stones and Mjolnir to their proper timelines and remains in the past
                    to live with Carter. In the present, an elderly Rogers passes his shield to Sam Wilson.</p>
