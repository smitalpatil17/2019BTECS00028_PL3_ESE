                <p class="card-text">Avengers: Infinity War is a 2018 American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics
                    superhero team the Avengers. Produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Studios
                    Motion Pictures, it is the sequel to The Avengers (2012) and Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015), and the
                    19th film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). In the film, the Avengers and the Guardians of the
                    Galaxy attempt to prevent Thanos from collecting the six all-powerful Infinity Stones as part of his
                    quest to kill half of all life in the universe.</p>
                <p class="card-text">Having acquired the Power Stone–one of the six Infinity Stones–from the planet
                    Xandar, Thanos and his lieutenants: Ebony Maw, Cull Obsidian, Proxima Midnight, and Corvus Glaive,
                    intercept the spaceship carrying the survivors of Asgard's destruction.[N 1] After subduing Thor,
                    Thanos extracts the Space Stone from the Tesseract, overpowers the Hulk, and kills Loki. Thanos also
                    kills Heimdall after he sends Hulk to Earth using the Bifröst. Thanos and his lieutenants leave,
                    destroying the ship.
                    Hulk crash-lands in the Sanctum Sanctorum in New York City, reverting to the form of Bruce Banner.
                    He warns Stephen Strange and Wong about Thanos' plan to destroy half of all life in the universe,
                    and they recruit Tony Stark. Maw and Obsidian arrive to retrieve the Time Stone from Strange,
                    drawing Peter Parker's attention. Maw is unable to take the Time Stone due to an enchantment and
                    captures Strange. Stark and Parker sneak aboard Maw's spaceship while Wong stays behind to guard the
                    Sanctum.
                    The Guardians of the Galaxy respond to a distress call from the Asgardian ship and rescue Thor. Thor
                    surmises that Thanos is going after the Reality Stone, which Taneleer Tivan possesses on Knowhere.
                    He travels with Rocket and Groot to Nidavellir to enlist the aid of the dwarf king Eitri in creating
                    the battle-axe Stormbreaker. Peter Quill, Gamora, Drax, and Mantis travel to Knowhere, and they find
                    Thanos possessing the Reality Stone. Thanos kidnaps Gamora, who discloses the Soul Stone's location
                    to save Nebula from torture. On Vormir, the Stone's keeper, Red Skull, tells Thanos that he can only
                    acquire it by sacrificing someone he loves. Thanos kills Gamora, earning the Stone.
                    In Edinburgh, Midnight and Glaive ambush Wanda Maximoff and Vision to retrieve the Mind Stone in
                    Vision's forehead. Steve Rogers, Natasha Romanoff, and Sam Wilson rescue them and they take shelter
                    with James Rhodes and Banner at the Avengers Compound. Vision asks Maximoff to destroy him and the
                    Mind Stone to keep Thanos from retrieving it, but Maximoff refuses. Rogers suggests they travel to
                    Wakanda, which he believes has the resources to remove the Stone without killing Vision.
                    Nebula escapes captivity and asks the remaining Guardians to meet her on Thanos' destroyed
                    homeworld, Titan. Stark and Parker kill Maw and rescue Strange. They meet Quill, Drax and Mantis
                    after the three Guardians board Maw's ship, and they all land on Titan. Strange uses the Time Stone
                    to view millions of possible futures, seeing only one in which the Avengers win. The group
                    formulates a plan to subdue Thanos and remove the Infinity Gauntlet, which he uses to safely house
                    the Stones. Thanos appears and justifies his plans as necessary to guarantee the survival of a
                    universe threatened by overpopulation. Nebula arrives soon after and helps the others subdue Thanos,
                    but then deduces that Thanos has killed Gamora. Enraged, Quill attacks Thanos, inadvertently
                    allowing him to break the group's hold and overpower them. Thanos grievously wounds Stark, but
                    Strange offers the Time Stone in exchange for sparing Stark's life.
                    In Wakanda, Rogers reunites with Bucky Barnes before Thanos' army invades. The Avengers, along with
                    T'Challa and the Wakandan forces, mount a defense while Shuri works to extract the Mind Stone from
                    Vision. Unable to summon the Hulk after losing his fight with Thanos, Banner fights in Stark's
                    Hulkbuster armor. Thor, Rocket, and Groot arrive to reinforce the Avengers and together they kill
                    Midnight, Obsidian, and Glaive. Although Thanos' army is routed, Shuri is unable to complete the
                    extraction before Thanos himself arrives on the field. Maximoff destroys the Mind Stone and Vision,
                    but Thanos uses the Time Stone to reverse her actions and rips the repaired Mind Stone from Vision's
                    forehead, killing him. Thor severely wounds Thanos with Stormbreaker, but Thanos activates the
                    completed Gauntlet by snapping his fingers before teleporting away.
                    Half of all life across the universe disintegrates, including Barnes, T'Challa, Groot, Maximoff,
                    Wilson, Mantis, Drax, Quill, Strange, Parker, Maria Hill, and Nick Fury, though Fury is able to send
                    an emergency signal on a modified pager.[N 2] Stark and Nebula remain stranded on Titan while
                    Banner, M'Baku, Okoye, Rhodes, Rocket, Rogers, Romanoff, and Thor are left on the Wakandan
                    battlefield. Meanwhile, Thanos watches a sunrise on a remote planet.</p>
